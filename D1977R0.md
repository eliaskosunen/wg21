# Introduction {#intro}

There are currently multiple proposals in the library evolution pipeline, including
[@P1031R2] and [@P1883R0] _Low level file i/o library_ and
[@P1750R1] _A Proposal to Add Process Management to the C++ Standard Library_.
During the review of this papers by LEWGI in Belfast (November 2019),
it became apparent that it is presently unclear how errors with creating operating system resources are to be handled.
Encouraged by LEWGI, this paper attempts to establish clear guidance on this subject matter, for now and for the future.

Once decided, we propose for this policy to become a part of the future LEWG design policy standing document.
