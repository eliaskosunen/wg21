# Introduction {#intro}

In early 2019 in Kona, LEWGI saw [@P1402R0], titled "std::cstring_view - a C compatible std::string_view adapter".
The consensus from that discussion was, that this problem space is not to be pursued further:

> POLL: We should promise more committee time to pursuing a null-terminated string view,
> knowing that our time is scarce and this will leave less time for other work.

The author of this paper feels like this decision was ill-adviced, and in light of more evidence, would like to reignite the discussion.
For the sake of this paper, from here on out, this class is called `std::cstring_view`, but it may be subject to change in future revisions.

# Scope {#scope}

This paper is proposing adding a new class with similar characteristics to `std::string_view`,
with the notable exception of having an invariant of null-termination.

At this time, this paper does not go into more detail in the design of this class.

# Motivation {#motivation}

Operating system APIs are generally written in C, and thus, strings are expected to be null-terminated.
This means, that C++ wrapper APIs have two options:

```cpp
// Option 1: Take a const char*
void foo(const char* string);
// Option 2: Take a string_view
void foo(string_view string);
```
