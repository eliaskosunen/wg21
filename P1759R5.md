# Abstract {#abstract}

This paper proposes adding a new typedef to standard file streams: `native_handle_type`.
This type is an alias to whatever type the platform uses for its file descriptors:
`int` on POSIX, `HANDLE` (`void*`) on Windows, and something else on other platforms.
This type is a non-owning handle and has generally sane semantics:
default constructability, trivial copyability and it's standard layout.

Alongside this, this paper proposes adding a concrete member function: `.native_handle()`,
returning a `native_handle_type`, to the following class templates:

 * `basic_filebuf`
 * `basic_ifstream`
 * `basic_ofstream`
 * `basic_fstream`

# Revision History {#history}

Incorporate LEWGI feedback from Cologne (July 2019):
  
  * Move to a member function and member typedef
  * Make `native_handle` return value not be mandated to be unique
  * Add note about how the presence of the members is required, and not implementation-defined (like for thread)

## R0 {#r0}

Initial revision.

# Design Discussion {#design}

## Implementation-definedness of native handles and presence of them {#impl-defined}

The wording related to native handles in [thread.req.native]{.sref} is as follows:

> Several classes described in this Clause have members `native_handle_type` and `native_handle`.
> The presence of these members and their semantics is implementation-defined.
> [ *Note:* These members allow implementations to provide access to implementation details.
> Their names are specified to facilitate portable compile-time detection.
> Actual use of these members is inherently non-portable.
> &mdash; *end note* ]

In more plain terms, the presence of native handles in `std::thread`, `std::mutex`, and `std::condition_variable`, is implementation-defined,
without a way to query, whether they are provided (except with SFINAE magic).
This design is deemed bad by the author and by LEWG, so this paper aims to not do that again.

The wording related to native handles in [stacktrace.entry.obs]{.sref} is as follows:

> The semantics of this function are implementation-defined.
> 
> _Remarks:_ Successive invocations of the `native_handle`
> function for an unchanged `stacktrace_entry` object return identical values.

While this design is a huge step up compared to threads, the author would like to have more strict normative guarantees for this facility.

This paper proposes to:

 * set requirements for `native_handle_type`: `semiregular`ity, trivial copyability, standard-layout
 * define (semi-normatively), what a _native handle_ for a file means, and how it behaves

# Impact On the Standard and Existing Code {#impact}

This proposal is a pure library extension, requiring no changes to the core language.
It would cause no existing conforming code to break.

# Implementation {#implementation}

Implementing this paper should be a relatively trivial task.

Although all implementations surveyed (libstdc++, libc++ and MSVC) use `FILE*`
instead of native file descriptors in their `basic_filebuf` implementations,
these platforms provide facilites to get a native handle from a `FILE*`;
`fileno` on POSIX, and `_fileno` + `_get_osfhandle` on Windows.
The following reference implementations use these.

For libstdc++ on Linux:

```cpp
template <class CharT, class Traits>
class basic_filebuf : public basic_streambuf<CharT, Traits> {
    // ...
    using native_handle_type = int;
    // ...
    native_handle_type native_handle() {
        assert(is_open());
        // _M_file (__basic_file<char>) has a member function for this purpose
        return _M_file.fd();
        // ::fileno(_M_file.file()) could also be used
    }
    // ...
}
```

For libc++ on Linux:

```cpp
template <class CharT, class Traits>
class basic_filebuf : public basic_streambuf<CharT, Traits> {
    // ...
    using native_handle_type = int;
    // ...
    native_handle_type native_handle() {
        assert(is_open());
        // __file_ is a FILE*
        return ::fileno(__file_)
    }
    // ...
}
```

For MSVC:

```cpp
template <class CharT, class Traits>
class basic_filebuf : public basic_streambuf<CharT, Traits> {
    // ...
    using native_handle_type = HANDLE;
    // ...
    native_handle_type native_handle() {
        assert(is_open());
        // _Myfile is a FILE*
        auto cfile = ::_fileno(_Myfile);
        // _get_osfhandle returns intptr_t, which can be cast to HANDLE (void*)
        return static_cast<HANDLE>(::_get_osfhandle(cfile));
    }
    // ...
}
```

For all of these cases, implementing `.native_handle()` for `ifstream`, `ofstream` and `fstream` is trivial:

```cpp
template <class CharT, class Traits>
class basic_ifstream : public basic_istream<CharT, Traits> {
    // ...
    using native_handle_type =
        typename basic_filebuf<CharT, Traits>::native_handle_type;
    // ...
    native_handle_type native_handle() {
        return rdbuf()->native_handle();
    }
};

// Repeat for ofstream and fstream
```

# Technical Specifications {#specification}

## Wording notes {#notes}

The wording is based on [@N4928].

## Feature test macro {#ft-macro}

This paper proposes adding a feature test macro, called `__cpp_lib_fstream_native_handle`.

## Wording {#wording}

### Add the following section into _File-based streams_ [file.streams]

This section is to come between [fstream.syn]{.sref} and [filebuf]{.sref}.

_Note to editor:_ Replace the ? with the appropriate section number. As of [@N4928], that would be 31.10.2.  
Also, replace the ? in the Note with the appropriate note number.

::: add

> **?.?.? Native handles [file.native]**
> 
> \pnum{1} Several classes described in this section have a member `native_handle_type`.
> 
> \pnum{2} The type `native_handle_type` represents a platform-specific *native handle* to a file.
> It is trivially copyable and standard layout, and models `semiregular`.
> 
> \pnum{3} [ *Note ?:* For operating systems based on POSIX, `native_handle_type` is `int`.
> For Windows-based operating systems, `native_handle_type` is `HANDLE`. &mdash; _end note_ ]

### Modify *Class template `basic_filebuf`* [filebuf]

```diff
namespace std {

    basic_filebuf* open(const filesystem::path::value_type* s,
                        ios_base::openmode mode);  // wide systems only; see 31.10.1
    basic_filebuf* open(const string& s,
                        ios_base::openmode mode);
    basic_filebuf* open(const filesystem::path& s,

}
```

> Whether a value of `native_handle_type` not obtained by calling `native_handle()` may be a valid native handle is implementation-defined.
> Whether the associated native handle is unique for each file, is implementation-defined.

### Add to the end of *Member functions* [filebuf.members]

This would come after the definition of `basic_filebuf::close()`, which occupies paragraphs 8-10.
